<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Each week I&#39;ll record your contributions to the class/group following the same outline.
You&#39;ll export this assignment to markdown (or download it as a markdown file) and add it to your group&#39;s Github.
You&#39;ll want to change the file name to include your ucid so it doesn&#39;t conflict with anyone else&#39;s files if it&#39;s in the same directory.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required to keep this branch in sync with all team members each module/week (you shouldn&#39;t cause anyone to lose their work).

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>We were tasked with searching for different load balancers because we needed to<br>use it for one of the deliverables. For this, I choose to use<br>an elastic load balancer that is provided by AWS.&nbsp; There were a lot<br>of cool features that I liked about it, and it was interesting to<br>do the research and learn about the different load balancers and their uses.<br></p><br></td></tr>
